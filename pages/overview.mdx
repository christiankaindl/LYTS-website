import { Box, Columns } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'
import Link from 'next/link'

export { default } from 'components/SidebarLayout/SidebarLayout'

Layout components come **unstyled** with a **minimal API surface**. LYTS is [is less than 4kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@christiankaindl/lyts@1.0.0-alpha.10) when using *all* components and is also tree-shakable, so features that you don't use will not add to your bundle size.

There are 5 main components (<Link href='/components/stack'>Stack</Link>, <Link href='/components/row'>Row</Link>, <Link href='/components/clamp'>Clamp</Link>, <Link href='/components/columns'>Columns</Link>, <Link href='/components/grid'>Grid</Link>) and 3 helper components (<Link href='/components/box'>Box</Link>, <Link href='/components/split'>Split</Link>, <Link href='/components/breakout'>Breakout</Link>). Let's look at some of the features which are available on all components:

## Layout as props

LYTS exposes layout-specific functionality as props on its components. The <Link href='/components/box'><a>Box</a></Link> component, which all others inherit, supports a few handy props:

### Optical alignment: `bleed`

Sometimes what is technically aligned is not visually aligned to our eyes. LYTS provides the `bleed` prop (as well as `*Top`/`*Right`/`*Bottom`/`*Left`), which makes it easy to nudge (or bleed) elements outside their bounding box to make them look visually aligned.

Slava Shestopalov's "[Optical Effects in User Interfaces](https://medium.muz.li/optical-effects-9fca82b4cd9a)" dives into this topic in great detail.

### Horizontal & vertical alignment: `xAlign`/`yAlign`

CSS Flexbox provides `alignItems` and `justifyContent` properties to control the alignment of children from the parent element. Depending on the `flex-direction`, each property controls a different axis.

LYTS normalizes this into `xAlign` and `yAlign` props, so you don't have to think about those details while writing layout code. Of course, manually setting alignItems/justifyContent still works as well.

### Render as anything: `asChild`

By default, all LYTS components render a `<div>` element. This is not always desirable, because you should use semantic HTML wherever possible, which means changing the rendered element. To support this, LYTS provides the `asChild` prop on all components.

```jsx
const MyComponent = function () {
  return (
    // Because of `asChild`, only the <a> element will be rendered, without an additionl wrapping div.
    <Row asChild gap={0.5}>
      <a href='/bla'>
        <span>Interesting link</span>
        <ArrowRightIcon />
      </a>
    </Row>
  )
}
```

The `asChild` API works exactly like all Radix UI components, and is even using their `<Slot />` component under-the-hood. Check out the <Link href='https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/utilities/slot'>official documentation for Slot</Link>.

## Global styling

LYTS exposes all CSS classes and custom properties, which are used by the components internally, as a JavaScript API. This makes it possible to, for example, add global styles targeting all or individual LYTS components. To use this feature a JS based approach to styling is required, such as [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) or [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/):

```ts
/* MyComponent.css.ts */
import { stackStyles, toSelectorString } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'
import { globalStyle } from '@vanilla-extract/css'

const stackSelector = toSelectorString(stackStyles.stack)
globalStyle(stackSelector, {
  backgroundColor: 'whitesmoke',
  outline: '1px solid blue'
})
```

For example, this documentation site uses the class names API to render examples with [colored outlines](https://github.com/christiankaindl/LYTS-website/blob/main/styles/index.css.ts).

The class names API can also be used to change already existing style defaults. For example, this site uses a global style for the HTML `<a>` tag, but [special-cases the selector](https://github.com/christiankaindl/LYTS-website/blob/main/styles/index.css.ts) with a ":not()" function to not inlcude links which are a LYTS component (they are styled separately and don't need the default link styling).

## Server-side rendering

All components support rendering on the server. Container-based props such as <Link href='/components/columns'>Columns</Link>' `collapseAt` use native CSS features instead of resorting to a Resize Observer, which ensures that the first render on the client is always the same as what was rendered on the server.

## Compatability & browser support

LYTS uses the CSS `gap` property for spacing, as well as other quite modern CSS features such as the `min()`, and `minmax()` functions. These are now supported by the [vast majority of users](https://caniuse.com/?search=gap), but that may still be a deal-breaker if you need to support older browsers.
