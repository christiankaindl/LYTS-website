import { Box, Columns } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'
import Link from 'next/link'

export { default } from 'components/SidebarLayout/SidebarLayout'

1. Drop-in—Use as much or as little as you need
1. Composable—Combine to create complex layouts
1. Familiar—Apply standard CSS flexbox and grid knowledge

All layout components come **unstyled** and expose simple yet convenience props. LYTS' bundle size [is less than 4kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@christiankaindl/lyts@1.0.0-alpha.10) when using all components and exports, and is tree-shakable.

## Layout as props

Getting to your desired layout should be as straightforward as possible. That's why LYTS exposes layout-specific functionality as props on its components. The <Link href='/components/box'><a>Box</a></Link> component, which all others inherit, supports a few handy props:

### Optical alignment: `bleed`

Sometimes what is technically aligned is not visually aligned to our eyes. For example, consider this button:
[[Example here]]

Technically, the button is aligned perfectly with the rest of the card, but its internal padding makes it look visually un-aligned. To fix this LYTS provides the `bleed` prop (and *Top/*Right/*Bottom/*Left), which makes it easy to nudge the button to the left, and "bleed" into the bounding box to visually align it:
[[Example here]]

<Columns collapseAt='30em'>
  <Box>
    Before
    <img />
  </Box>
  <Box>
    After
    <img />
  </Box>
</Columns>

### Vertical & horizontal alignment: `xAlign`/`yAlign`

CSS Flexbox provides `alignItems` and `justifyContent` to control alignment of children from the parent element. Depending on the flex-direction the control either the vertical or horizontal alignment, which can be quite confusing and easy to forget which does which.

LYTS normalizes this into "xAlign" and "yAlign" props which can be used on all components. Of course, manually setting alignItems/justifyContent still works as expected.

### Render as anything: `asChild`

By default, all LYTS components render a \<div> element. But if you use semantic HTML (which you should), you often want to change the rendered element to get the correct behaviors out-of-the-box (keyboard interactions, screen-readers).

Side note: The `asChild` API is inspired by Radix UI (we use their \<Slot /> component internally). It is an alternative to the commonly used `as` prop. `asChild` gives you more indentation, but composes in a clearer way with multiple `asChild` components.

## Global styling

LYTS exports the CSS class names the library uses internally as a JavaScript API. This makes it possible to, for example, add global styles targeting all or individual LYTS components. This documentation site uses the class names API to render examples with [colored outlines](https://github.com/christiankaindl/LYTS-website/blob/main/styles/index.css.ts).

The class names API can also be used to improve already existing style defaults. For example, this site uses a global style for the HTML \<a> tag, but [special-cases the selector](https://github.com/christiankaindl/LYTS-website/blob/main/styles/index.css.ts) with a ":not()" function to not inlcude links which are a LYTS layout context, because links which are a layout context are often a button-like elements which don't need the default link styling.

## Server-side rendering

All components work out-of-the-box when rendering on the server. Container-based props such as Columns' `collapseAt` use CSS techniques instead of resorting to a Resize Observer, which ensures that the first render on the client is always the same as what was rendered on the server.

## Examples

Most apps and websites use the same types of layout primitives in their design. From navbars, cards, overlays, sidebars, breadcrumbs, etc. Most all of them are easily implemented with LYTS and a lot of them have examples you can copy/paste directly into your projects.

<Link href='/examples'><a style={{ alignSelf: 'start' }}>Check out the examples</a></Link>

## Compatability & browser support

LYTS uses the CSS `gap` property for spacing, which is supported by the vast majority of users' browsers. An earlier version used the negative margin technique (as described in [Every Layout's "The Cluster"](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/cluster/)) to achive the same effect (with better browser support), but had some drawbacks:

- It renders 2 containers for every layout context
- Bleeding via margins only possible with another additional wrapper element

Layout components are used *a lot*, which can lead to a lot of unnecessary DOM elements on a page. The `gap` property is now well supported in browsers so the trade-off has been made to rely on it. Additionally, now negative `margin` values can be used to achieve visually align elements, like ghost buttons, easily.

## Aknowledgements

LYTS is the spiritual successor of [@quantargo/react-layout](https://github.com/quantargo/react-layout), which is used in production at [quantargo.com](https://www.quantargo.com). However there are quite a few adaptations and changes compared to it. Some of them, such moving from the negative margin technique to using native CSS `gap` are because of better browser support these days. Others, like various API changes and improvements, are based on extensive usage of the library.
