LYTS was originally designed and written by me, Christian Kaindl. But, as anything great, I didn't (and couldn't) have done everything myself. This is the "inspiration" page, with many useful links and much to explore. So grab your coffe (or tea) and read on!

First things first, LYTS is the spiritual successor of [@quantargo/react-layout](https://github.com/quantargo/react-layout), which is used in production on [quantargo.com](https://www.quantargo.com). Without it LYTS would never have come to be in the first place.

The original design and implementation of LYTS was also influenced by a lot of people in the web community, as well as my own experience working with React and design systems. Here's a non-exhaustive, unordered list of people and projects which influenced LYTS:

### Josh Comeau

Josh is probably already known to many. His writing style and blog posts are a great ressource in of itself. Specifically, LYTS implements the [Full-bleed layout using CSS Grid]() technique (see Clamp).

### Heydon Pickering

Heydon's work is very foundational and always uses a [first-principles]() aproach to problems and API design. LYTS implements his [Holy albatross]() technique (see Columns). Quantargo's React Layout (the predecessor to LYTS) also used the [negative margin technique](), which I first read about on Heydon's brilliant every-layout.dev

### Jon Yablonski

Jon Yablonski's lawsofux.com has been a great resource and inspiration, both in its design as well as in its content.

### Mark Dalgleish: vanilla-extract, CSS Modules, general design, capsize

Mark is pretty much an icon, heavily influencing the web development landscape with his projects like the universally used [CSS Modules](), its "successor" [vanilla-extract](), [Capsize]() and many more, as well as his design thinking.

LYTS (as well as this docs site) is buit using vanilla-extract and Capsize, and directly influenced by Mark's public sharings around layout components and design systems.

### Radix UI: Primitives, colors, API design

Radix UI's components are extremely well-built. Their API design has been an inspiration and their Radix UI's [colors]() are used for the docs website as well. Besides this, LYTS uses their [Slot]() component to implement the `asChild` prop, which is available on all layout components.

## Alternatives to LYTS

- Bedrock Layout primitives (React, vanilla)
- Every Layout (web components)
- Quantargo React Layout.
