LYTS was originally designed and written by me, Christian Kaindl. But, as anything great, I didn't (and couldn't) have done everything myself. This is the "inspiration" page, with many useful links and much to explore. So grab your coffee (or tea) and read on!

First things first: LYTS is the spiritual successor of [@quantargo/react-layout](https://github.com/quantargo/react-layout), which is used in production on [quantargo.com](https://www.quantargo.com) and also written by me. Without it, LYTS would never have come to be in the first place.

The original design and implementation of LYTS was also influenced by a lot of people in the web community, as well as my own experience working with React and design systems. Here's a non-exhaustive, unordered list of people and projects which influenced LYTS:

### Josh Comeau

Josh is probably already known to many. His writing style and blog posts are a great resource in and of itself and always pushes the bar on detail and polish. Besides that, LYTS implements the [Full-bleed layout using CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/) technique in the Clamp component.

### Heydon Pickering

Heydon's work always uses a first-principles approach to problems and API design, breaking things down to its fundamentals. The first time I read about the [negative margin technique](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/cluster/#the-solution), which I first read about on Heydon's brilliant *every-layout.dev*. LYTS implements the [Holy albatross](https://heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatross-reincarnated/) in the Columns component.

### Jon Yablonski

Jon Yablonski's [lawsofux.com](https://lawsofux.com) has been a great resource and inspiration, both in its design as well as in its content.

### Mark Dalgleish

Mark is pretty much an icon, heavily influencing the web development landscape with his projects like the universally used [CSS Modules](), its "successor" [vanilla-extract]() and many more. LYTS (as well as this docs site) is built using vanilla-extract, and is directly influenced by Mark's public sharings around layout components and design thinking.

### Radix UI

Radix UI's "Primitives" are extremely well-built. Their API design has been a direct influence to me, and their Radix UI's [colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) are used for this very docs website. Besides this, LYTS uses their [Slot](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/utilities/slot) component to implement the `asChild` prop, which is available on all layout components.

## Alternatives to LYTS

- [Bedrock Layout Primitives](https://bedrock-layout.dev/?path=/story/overview-bedrock-layout-primitives--page) (React and vanilla JS)
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev) (Web Components)
