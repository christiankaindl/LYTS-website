# Get started

Adding LYTS to your projects only takes a few minutes.

The goal of LYTS is to make building layouts easier, faster and more maintainable. The components consist of low-level primitives which give a simple API you can build on top of.

Fundamentally, the code should express the designers intent as much as possible while staying flexible and composable. All components work out-of-the-box with zero configuration and sensible defaults.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @christiankaindl/lyts
```

## Usage


Import the library CSS styles early in your application. For example in a Next.js app, import in `_app.js`:

```jsx
/** _app.js */
import '@christiankaindl/lyts/style.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

That's the whole setup! Now import one of the available components--Stack, Row, Clamp, Columns, Grid--and use them to get nice and consistent layouts.

Compose layout components until you achieve your desired layout. The following \<CenterCard> component creates a card with a max-width of 750px and centers it:

```tsx
const CenterCard: FunctionComponent = function () {
  return (
    // A card with a max-width of 750px and centers it
    <Clamp clamp='750px'>
      <Stack gap={0.75} className='card'>
        <img src='' />
        <h3>Card title</h3>
        <Row wrap gap={0.5}>
          <InfoIcon />
          <p>Info: This is a card</p>
        </Row>
        <Box xAlign='end'>Aligned to the right</Box>
      </Stack>
    </Clamp>
  )
}
```
