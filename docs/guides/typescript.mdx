description: Add types to your components to support layout props.
---

LYTS supports TypeScript and exports various interfaces and types for each component:

``` js
import {
  BoxProps,
  StackProps,
  RowProps,
  // etc...
} from '@christiankaindl/lyts'
```

You can use these types with your own custom components. For example, if you want to support layout props in addition to your own custom props:

``` tsx
import { StackProps } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

interface CardProps {
  myProp?: string
}

const Card: FunctionComponent<CardProps & StackProps> = function ({
  children,
  myProp,
  ...props
}) {
  return (
    <Stack {...props}>
      {children}
    </Stack>
  )
}
```

Now when using this component, you can not only pass `myProp` but also any prop from Stack.
