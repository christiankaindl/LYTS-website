TODO: Move to SSR page

For most layouts, the default LYTS props get you where you want. But there are cases where you may want more control over the behavior on different screen sizes.

A common use case for this is a sidebar/details view where you want a full sidebar on desktop, but on mobile you want to have a navbar with a button opening a menu.

## The problem

## The solution

```ts
import { createMedia } from "@artsy/fresnel"

// Specify the breakpoints we want
// In this case, we only want to handle the mobile case differently
const MediaQuery = createMedia({
  breakpoints: {
    xs: 0,
    mobile: 768
  },
})

// Make styles for injection into the header of the page
export const mediaStyles = MediaQuery.createMediaStyle()

// These components will be used next
export const { Media, MediaContextProvider } = MediaQuery
```
