import { Box, Columns } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Columns are extrinsically sized. This means that its children's width is determined by its parent (the Columns container). By default every child takes up 1 fraction of the available space, but this can be customized by the `ratio` prop (the example above has a ratio of "1/2").

This behavior is perfect for landing page sections, where you want the same ratios for every section. This also works great for sidebar layouts. You can set a min- and maxWidth on the sidebar to get dynamic sizing, all while staying in a legible width (the sidebar layout of this very site is using \<Columns>!)

To support mobile devices, Columns automatically collapses into a single-column layout when the Columns container reaches the width of the `collapseAt`, such as "28em" in this example (resize the window to try it out!).
