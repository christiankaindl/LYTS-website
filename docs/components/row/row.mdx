import { Row, Box, Split } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Use Split when you need to stack elements horizontally. This has many use cases such as [toolbars](/examples/toolbar), [breadcrumbs](/examples/breadcrumbs) or a [list of tags](/examples/wrapped-tags).

## Wrapping

Row supports the `wrap` prop, which says that elements should *wrap* into the next line when the current row doesn't have enaugh space. This is commonly used when displaying a set of tags, or metadata where the content is often dynamic:

<Row wrap style={{ maxWidth: 500 }}>
  <Pill>Name: LYTS</Pill>
  <Pill>By Christian Kaindl</Pill>
  <Pill>Written in TypeScript</Pill>
  <Pill>CSS</Pill>
  <Pill>React</Pill>
  <Pill>package</Pill>
  <Pill>layout</Pill>
</Row>

export const Pill = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <span style={{ borderRadius: 99, backgroundColor: 'rgb(0, 0, 0, .07)', padding: '4px 12px', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>
      {children}
    </span>
  )
}

## Split-layouts

It is common to  have elements on opposite sides of each other, but aligned on the same axis. LYTS provides the Split component, which can be used together with Row and Stack to "split" up the remaining space:

<Row>
  <Box>Item #1</Box>
  <Box>Item #2</Box>
  <Split />
  <Box>Item #3</Box>
</Row>

Split layouts also work great with the `wrap` prop. When used together you get a large layout on desktops which collapses below each other on small screens. This is perfect for toolbars:

<Row gap={1.5} wrap>
  <b>
    Toolbar
  </b>
  <Split />
  <Row>
    <span>Edit</span>
    <span>Share</span>
    <span>Like</span>
  </Row>
</Row>

The elements "Edit", "Share" and "Like" are contained in another Row (but could be any container) and will wrap to the next line at the same time, removing odd in-between states when resizing.

## Aligning children

By default, Row centers its children vertically, and start-aligns (left) items horizontally. But this can be easily customized with the `xAlign` and `yAlign` props:

<Row>
  <Box>Item #1</Box>
  <Box>Item #2</Box>
  <Box>Item #3</Box>
</Row>

<Row xAlign='center'>
  <Box>Item #1</Box>
  <Box>Item #2</Box>
  <Box>Item #3</Box>
</Row>

<Row xAlign='end'>
  <Box>Item #1</Box>
  <Box>Item #2</Box>
  <Box>Item #3</Box>
</Row>
