import { Box, Grid, Breakout } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Use Grid if you need a layout with shared column sizing across multiple rows. In a grid, even when not all spaces are filled, the space for all columns is always reserved, which makes it a great choice for structured content display, such as [blog posts]().

## Break-out elements

Grid also supports "break-out" elements, which are a common way to highlight the first item in a grid with a larger appearance. Break-out elements are supported via the \<Breakout> component:

<Grid gridItemMinWidth='13em'>
  <Breakout xAlign='center' yAlign='center'>
    Hero card (Breakout)
  </Breakout>
  <Box xAlign='center' yAlign='center'>
    Card #1
  </Box>
  <Box xAlign='center' yAlign='center'>
    Card #2
  </Box>
  <Box xAlign='center' yAlign='center'>
    Card #3
  </Box>
</Grid>

Breakout is a helper component which sets CSS' `grid-column` to "1 / -1", which makes it span all columns within a row.
