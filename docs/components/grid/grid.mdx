import { Box, Grid, Breakout } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Use Grid if you need a layout with shared column sizing across multiple rows. In a grid, even when not all spaces are filled, the space for all columns is always reserved, which makes it a great choice for structured content display, such as [blog posts]().

## Break-out elements

Grid also supports "break-out" elements, which are a common way to highlight the first item in a grid with a larger appearance. Break-out elements are supported via the [Breakout](/components/breakout) component:

<CodeEditor
  defaultExpanded
  code={
`<Grid gridItemMinWidth='13em'>
  <Breakout xAlign='center' yAlign='center'>
    Hero card with Breakout
  </Breakout>
  <Box />
  <Box />
  <Box />
</Grid>`}
/>

Breakout is a helper component which sets CSS' `grid-column` to "1 / -1", which makes it span all columns within a row.
