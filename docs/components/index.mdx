import { icons } from '../../pages'
import { Tooltip } from '@/components/Tooltip/Tooltip'
import { Row } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

<Row style={{ padding: '0 2em 0 0' }} wrap>
  {icons.map(({ name, icon, href }) => {
    return (
      <Tooltip delayDuration={0} key={name}>
        <Link href={href} passHref>
          <Tooltip.Trigger asChild>
            <a aria-label={name}>{icon}</a>
          </Tooltip.Trigger>
        </Link>
        <Tooltip.Content>
          {name}
        </Tooltip.Content>
      </Tooltip>
    )
  })}
</Row>

Layout components come unstyled with a minimal API surface. LYTS is [is less than 4kB](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@christiankaindl/lyts@1.0.0-alpha.10) when using *all* components and is also tree-shakable, so features that you don't use will not add to your bundle size.

## Layout props

LYTS exposes layout-specific functionality as props on its components, each component has its own props specific for its problem domain. All layout components inherit props from <Link href='/components/box'><a>Box</a></Link> making the following props available globally:

### `bleed`: Optical alignment

Sometimes what is technically aligned is not visually aligned to our eyes. LYTS provides the `bleed` prop (as well as `*Top`/`*Right`/`*Bottom`/`*Left`), which makes it easy to nudge (or bleed) elements outside their bounding box to make them look visually aligned.

Slava Shestopalov's "[Optical Effects in User Interfaces](https://medium.muz.li/optical-effects-9fca82b4cd9a)" dives into this topic in great detail.

### `xAlign`/`yAlign`: Horizontal & vertical alignment

CSS Flexbox provides `alignItems` and `justifyContent` properties to control the alignment of children from the parent element. Depending on the `flex-direction`, each property controls a different axis.

LYTS normalizes this into `xAlign` and `yAlign` props, so you don't have to think about those details while writing layout code. Of course, manually setting alignItems/justifyContent still works as well.

### `asChild`: Render as anything

By default, all LYTS components render a `<div>` element. This is not always desirable, because you should use semantic HTML wherever possible, which means changing the rendered element. To support this, LYTS provides the `asChild` prop on all components.

```jsx
const MyComponent = function () {
  return (
    // Because of `asChild`, only the <a> element will be rendered, without an additionl wrapping div.
    <Row asChild gap={0.5}>
      <a href='/bla'>
        <span>Interesting link</span>
        <ArrowRightIcon />
      </a>
    </Row>
  )
}
```

The `asChild` API works exactly like all Radix UI components, and is even using their `<Slot />` component under-the-hood. Check out the <Link href='https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/utilities/slot'>official documentation for Slot</Link>.
