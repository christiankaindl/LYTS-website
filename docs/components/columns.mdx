    ### Equal columns

    Columns are extrinsically distributed. By default every child takes up 1 fraction of the available space, but this can be customized by the `ratio` prop (this one has a ratio of "1/2").

    Columns automatically collapses into a single-column layout when the `collapseAt` prop is reached, such as "28em" in this example (resize the window to try it out!).
  </Stack>
</Columns>
