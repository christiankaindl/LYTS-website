import { Clamp, Box, Breakout } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Use Clamp when you want to center elements with a max-width/-height. Common use cases for this behavior are [articles](/examples/article) and [overlays](/examples/overlay).

## Clamping vertically

The most common use case is to  passages of text and elements, but you can also clamp elements vertically by providing an array for the `clamp` prop, where the second value is the maximum height. This is handy for overlays, where you typically need to clamp both horizontally (width) and vertically (height):

<Clamp clamp={['400px', '200px']} style={{ height: 400 }}>
  <Box>
    Child
  </Box>
</Clamp>

In a real-world application, the Clamp container itself would be absolutely positioned to the viewport.

## Break-out elements

Clamp also supports "break-out" elements, made popular by Josh Comeau's [*Full-Bleed Layout Using CSS Grid*](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/) (check it out, it's a great read!). With LYTS you can use the \<Breakout> component as a direct child to Clamp to make it "opt out" of the clamping and make it full-width:

<Clamp clamp={'400px'}>
  <Box>
    Clamped child
  </Box>
  <Breakout xAlign='center'>
    I am full-width!
  </Breakout>
  <Box>
    Clamped child
  </Box>
</Clamp>
