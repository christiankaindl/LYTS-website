import { Clamp, Box, Breakout } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Use Clamp when you want to center elements with a max-width/-height. Common use cases for this behavior are [articles](/examples/article) and [overlays](/examples/overlay).

## Clamping vertically

Clamp can also constrain an elements *height* rather than only its width, so that elements don't stretch the full *height* of the container. To clamp vertically, pass an array to the `clamp` prop, where the first value is the maximum width and the second value is the maximum *height*.

This overlay is clamped both horizontally (width) and vertically (height):

<Clamp clamp={['min(350px, 50vw)', '200px']} style={{ height: 400 }}>
  <Box />
</Clamp>

Note: in a real-world application, the Clamp container itself would be absolutely positioned to the viewport.

## Multiple children

Clamp supports multiple children when only horizontal clamping is used. When using multiple children, Clamp can be used similar to a Stack:

<Clamp clamp='min(350px, 50vw)'>
  <Box />
  <Box />
  <Box />
</Clamp>

## Break-out elements

Clamp also supports "break-out" elements, as described in Josh Comeau's [Full-Bleed Layout Using CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/) (check it out, it's a great read!). LYTS provides [Breakout](/components/breakout), which can be used as a direct child to Clamp to make it "opt out" of the clamping and become full-width:

<Clamp clamp='min(350px, 50vw)'>
  <Box />
  <Breakout xAlign='center'>
    Full-width element using `<Breakout>`
  </Breakout>
  <Box />
</Clamp>
