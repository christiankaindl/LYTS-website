import { Clamp, Box, Breakout } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Clamp's direct child will be clamped and centered to the specified width. In the example above, the inner boxes are clamped to a width of 300px.

## Clamping vertically

You can also clamp elements vertically by providing an array for the `clamp` prop. This is useful for overlays:

<Clamp clamp={['400px', '200px']} style={{ height: 400 }}>
  <Box>
    Child #1
  </Box>
</Clamp>

## Break-out elements

Clamp also supports "break-out" elements, made popular by Josh Comeau's [*Full-Bleed Layout Using CSS Grid*](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/) (check it out, it's a great read!). With LYTS you can use the \<Breakout> component as a direct child to Clamp to make it "opt-out" of the clamping and make it full-width:

<Clamp clamp={'400px'}>
  <Box>
    Clamped child
  </Box>
  <Breakout xAlign='center'>
    I am full-width!
  </Breakout>
  <Box>
    Clamped child
  </Box>
</Clamp>
