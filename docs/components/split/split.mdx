import { Split, Row } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Split takes no children and composes nicely with both [Stack](/components/stack) and [Row](/components/row), to act as a sort of *free space inhabitor*. Compared to using `justify-content` (or the aliased `xAlign`) with the value "space-between", Split doesn't require any extra wrapping elements.

See [Row](/components/row) for more complete usage.
