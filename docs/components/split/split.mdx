import { Split, Row } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'

Split takes no children and can be composed with both Stack and Row, to act as a sort of "free space inhabitor".

<Row>
  <b>Toolbar</b>
  <Split />
  <Row>
    <button>Share</button>
    <button>Menu</button>
    <button>Manage</button>
  </Row>
</Row>
