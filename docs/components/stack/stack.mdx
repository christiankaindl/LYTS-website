Use Stack when you need consistent spacing between elements and/or a way to group elements together easily. Most commonly used to space passages of text, controls like links in a sidebar, or sections on a landing page. Stack can be used large and small.

## Nesting stacks

Stacks can be nested within each other, which makes it easy to [visually group](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity/) elements together:

<Stack>
  <Box>
    ### This is a `<Stack>`
  </Box>
  <Box>
    All elements within a Stack are vertically spaced consistently, via the `gap` prop.
  </Box>
  <Stack gap={2.5}>
    <Box>
      You can also nest stack within stacks. This stack has a `gap` of 2.5
    </Box>
    <Box>
