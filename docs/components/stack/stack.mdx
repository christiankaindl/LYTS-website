Use Stack when you need consistent spacing between elements and/or a way to group elements together easily. Most commonly used to space passages of text, controls like links in a sidebar, or sections on a landing page. Stack can be used large and small.

## Nesting stacks

Stacks can be nested within each other with different gaps, making it easy to [visually group](https://lawsofux.com/law-of-proximity/) elements together:

<Stack gap={2.5}>
  <Stack>
    <Box>
      Child #1
    </Box>
    <Box>
      Child #2
    </Box>
  </Stack>
  <Stack>
    <Box>
      Child #1
    </Box>
    <Box>
      Child #2
    </Box>
  </Stack>
</Stack>

## Aligning children

By default Stack stretches its children to the full width (which is the CSS flexbox default), but this can be easily customized with the `xAlign` prop:

<Stack xAlign='start'>
  <Box>Some child</Box>
  <Box>Longer than the others</Box>
  <Box>Another child</Box>
</Stack>

<Stack xAlign='center'>
  <Box>Some child</Box>
  <Box>Longer than the others</Box>
  <Box>Another child</Box>
</Stack>

<Stack xAlign='end'>
  <Box>Some child</Box>
  <Box>Longer than the others</Box>
  <Box>Another child</Box>
</Stack>
