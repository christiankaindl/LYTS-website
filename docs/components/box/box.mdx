```js
import { Box, BoxProps, boxStyles } from '@christiankaindl/lyts'
```

Use Box as a generic flexbox component, providing useful features such as `bleed`, `asChild`, `xAlign` and `yAlign`. All layout components render a Box under-the-hood and inherit its props.

## Tweaking the gap

The most fundamental prop is the `gap` prop which responds to the size of the space between elements. Takes an integer, which is multiplied by 1em, or a pixel value, or any other valid CSS length.

## Rendering as custom element

Box renders a `<div>` by default, but this is customizable with the `asChild` prop. When `asChild={true}` then the first child element is used as the wrapper. This is similar to the `as` tag of many libraries, but takes a different approach [inspired by Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/utilities/slot). In fact, LYTS uses Radix UI's `<Slot>` for its implementation.

Essentially, all props from Box are forwarded to the direct child and Box itself does not render an additional `<div>`.
