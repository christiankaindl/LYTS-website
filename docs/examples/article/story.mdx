description: Create a common article layout with Clamp, with support for full-width "break out" elements.
components:
  - Clamp
  - Breakout

import Component from './Component.txt'

<CodeEditor

  code={Component}
/>

To achieve a simple article layout  the example is wrapped in a Clamp, which privides us with 3 things:

1. Consistent Stack-style vertical spacing (via the `gap` prop)
1. Horizontal clamping to a specified max-width
1. The ability to create "break-out" children (more on that below)

## What about that "break-out" thing?

Clamp is using a technique popularized by Josh Comeau's [*Full-Bleed Layout Using CSS Grid*](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/full-bleed/). With this technique, any direct child can "opt-out" of the clamping by using `grid-column` to "1 / -1". LYTS implements this behavior with the \<Breakout> component.

This makes it possible to use a Clamp at the top-level, but to still have the flexibility to include full-width content, such as section with a different background-color or -image.
