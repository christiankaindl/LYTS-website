title: Sidebar/details view
description: Use Columns with a combination of `ratio` and min-/max-width to create a responsive sidebar.
components:
  - Columns

import Component from './Component.txt'

<CodeEditor
  defaultExpanded
  code={Component}
/>

First we must decide how much space the sidebar and details view will get. In this example it is split up in a 1:3 ratio, meaning the sidebar takes up 25% of the width and the details view take up 75%.

This already gives us a nice baseline, but there's 2 things which should be improved still:

1. The layout doesn't yet work well on small screens. That is because we haven't added the `collapseAt` prop yet, so the layout scales down until no space is left.
1. When shrinking the screen you can notice that the sidebar gets too small (and too big when growing). That is because 25% of the width quickly becomes too little space to be legible.

## Adding `collapseAt`

The first issue is fixed quite easily. We simply specify a `collapseAt` value which we like, and Columns automatically collapses into a single-column layout after that. `collapseAt` specifies the *container* width at which the layout collapses. This is useful, because we could now also create a CSS media query to adapt the sidebar to something which works better for mobile.

## Polishing the sidebar 

To prevent the sidebar from getting to small or too big we ca usethe CSS `min-width` and `max-width` properties, which also play very nicely with the `ratio` prop. Together you get a smooth linear "width gradient" when resizing the window.

Fun fact: this is exactly how the sidebar/details view of this website is implemented. You can [have a look at the code]().
